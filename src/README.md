# HLola

**HLola** is a Haskell implementation of the Stream Runtime Verification language [Lola](http://software.imdea.org/~cesar/papers/2005/time05/time05.pdf) as an embedded Domain Specific Language.
In this directory, you will find the source code of **HLola**, along with the steps to use the engine and define new specifications, shown in the following sections.

## Docker image

We provide a [Docker image](https://hub.docker.com/r/imdeasoftware/hlola) ready to build and execute **HLola** specifications out of the box.

You can run the image and provide arguments `arg0`, `arg1`, `arg2` for the binary `HLola` in the docker image by running `docker run imdeasoftware/hlola arg0 arg1 arg2`.
If you choose to use the Docker image to try **HLola**, you can skip the following section.

## Building Process

To build the project, you will need to install the Haskell [Stack](https://docs.haskellstack.org/en/stable/README/) tool.

Then, you should run the following commands to build the entire project:

```bash
$> stack setup # which will set up all the environment needed to build HLola
$> stack install # which will build and install HLola
```

The resulting binary will be placed in the directory output by the following command:
```bash
$> stack path --local-bin
```

Make sure that the previous path is included in your PATH, so you can execute **HLola** by typing `$> HLola` in a shell.

## Definition of a new specification

To define a new specification, we need to create a Haskell file in the folder `src/Specs`. For example, we can name our specification `MySpec` and thus the path f the specification will be `src/Specs/MySpec.hs`.
See the example specifications in `src/Examples` to get insight on the general shape of an **HLola** specification.
This specification must declare a varible of type `Specification`, for example, let's say we define a `spec :: Specification`.
Then, we modify the main file at `app/Main.hs` to import our new specification using `import qualified Specs.MySpec as MySpec(spec)`.
Finally, we bind the variable `importedSpec` in `Main` to the imported specification: `importedSpec = MySpec.spec`.

## HLola execution

If you execute `HLola` without arguments, you will be prompted with a help screen:
```bash
$> HLola
Wrong arguments. Usage:
  HLola --analyse
  HLola --execute
  HLola QuickCheck
  HLola TestType backref tracelen
Modify Main.hs to specify the imported the spec to --analyse or --execute.
TestType must be one of (PeriodWidth | PeriodHeight | SmoothPeriodWidth | SmoothPeriodHeight | WindowTrueWidth | WindowTrueHeight), while backref and tracelen must be positive natural numbers.
$>
```

Analyse or execute the specification imported in Main.hs using `HLola --analyse` or `HLola --execute`.
Alternatively, **HLola** ships with some predefined specifications for testing the tool.
To see the use of QuickCheck over a spec in action, execute **HLola** using `HLola QuickCheck`.
You can execute a specification `spec` from the specifications shown in the paper to appear in [APLAS 2020](https://conf.researchr.org/home/aplas-2020) to stress the monitor by choosing a trace length `tracelen` and a back reference `backref`, and then executing `HLola TestType backref tracelen`.

If you are working on the Docker image, the binaries are ready to execute, but if you have downloaded the sources to your machine, make sure to `stack install` **HLola** before running the experiments.
